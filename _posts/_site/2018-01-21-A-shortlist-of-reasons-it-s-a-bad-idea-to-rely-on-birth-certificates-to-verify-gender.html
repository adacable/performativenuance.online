<ul>
  <li>Not everyone has a birth certificate</li>
  <li>Asking people to pay a significant amount of money to be accepted excludes working class folk.</li>
  <li>Not everyone is born in the uk.</li>
  <li>People not born in the UK might not be from countries that issue an equivilent document.</li>
  <li>People not born in the UK might come from states that don’t exist any more.</li>
  <li>Or states that are actively trying to kill them.</li>
  <li>Or just states that don’t want to help people do the thing you’re policing.</li>
  <li>Or states that just lost all their records.</li>
  <li>Or states that have no gender recognition process.</li>
  <li>Some peoples parents didn’t register them with the state.</li>
  <li>Maybe because the state is authoritarian and polices based on children.</li>
  <li>Or the parents are just scared.</li>
  <li>Or poor.</li>
  <li>Or from an oppressed minority which the state doesn’t recognise.</li>
  <li>Different countries hold people to different standards for evidence- your weird policing of gender is based on categories that vary randomly based on where someone was born.</li>
  <li>Some folks are estranged from their parents, making it harder to get certificates.</li>
  <li>Nonbinary people exist, and many nations don’t realise that.</li>
  <li>Intersex people exist, and birth certificates for intersex people are a quagmire you don’t want to get into, and it’s a different one for every country on the planet.</li>
  <li>States generally hate leftists, queers, people of colour, etc, and relying on the state reproduces those oppressions.</li>
  <li><strong>A person can experience more than one of these at once.</strong></li>
  <li>You probably don’t need to “verify gender”, most men don’t find women’s services helpful, and if your women’s space doesn’t have a “no creeps” rule then you’ve probably got bigger problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>TL;DR: No, really, men don’t need all women’s shortlists to get elected. If they did, we wouldn’t need all women’s shortlists. Any man pretending to be a woman to get on an all womens shortlist is certainly going to have a harder time getting elected than just…running as a man.</p>

<p>Can we argue about something important now, like how it takes three years to get humiliating treatment on the NHS, resulting in mass suicides?</p>

<p>Or how the issues with borders I named above prevent, for example, women getting abortions in ireland, or how some people from failed states have to live essentially undocumented lives.</p>

<p>I don’t really care, as long as it’s not middle class white women trying to shit on women who don’t meet their standards.</p>
