title: "A shortlist of reasons it\u2019s a bad idea to rely on birth certificates\
  \ to \u201Cverify gender\u201D"
---

* Not everyone has a birth certificate
* Asking people to pay a significant amount of money to be accepted excludes working class folk.
* Not everyone is born in the uk.
* People not born in the UK might not be from countries that issue an equivilent document.
* People not born in the UK might come from states that don’t exist any more.
* Or states that are actively trying to kill them.
* Or just states that don’t want to help people do the thing you’re policing.
* Or states that just lost all their records.
* Or states that have no gender recognition process.
* Some peoples parents didn’t register them with the state.
* Maybe because the state is authoritarian and polices based on children.
* Or the parents are just scared.
* Or poor.
* Or from an oppressed minority which the state doesn’t recognise.
* Different countries hold people to different standards for evidence- your weird policing of gender is based on categories that vary randomly based on where someone was born.
* Some folks are estranged from their parents, making it harder to get certificates.
* Nonbinary people exist, and many nations don’t realise that.
* Intersex people exist, and birth certificates for intersex people are a quagmire you don’t want to get into, and it’s a different one for every country on the planet.
* States generally hate leftists, queers, people of colour, etc, and relying on the state reproduces those oppressions.
* **A person can experience more than one of these at once.**
* You probably don’t need to “verify gender”, most men don’t find women’s services helpful, and if your women’s space doesn’t have a “no creeps” rule then you’ve probably got bigger problems.


TL;DR: No, really, men don’t need all women’s shortlists to get elected. If they did, we wouldn’t need all women’s shortlists. Any man pretending to be a woman to get on an all womens shortlist is certainly going to have a harder time getting elected than just…running as a man.


Can we argue about something important now, like how it takes three years to get humiliating treatment on the NHS, resulting in mass suicides?


Or how the issues with borders I named above prevent, for example, women getting abortions in ireland, or how some people from failed states have to live essentially undocumented lives.


I don’t really care, as long as it’s not middle class white women trying to shit on women who don’t meet their standards.
